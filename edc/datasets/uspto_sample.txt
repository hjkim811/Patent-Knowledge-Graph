A fabrication process employing the use of ScAlN as an etch mask is disclosed.
The ScAlN etch mask is chemically nonvolatile in fluorine-based etch chemistries and has a low sputter yield, resulting in greater etch mask selectivity and reduced surface roughness for silicon and other semiconductor materials.
The ScAlN etch mask has an etch mask selectivity of greater than 200,000:1 relative to silicon compared to an etch mask selectivity of less than 40,000:1 for a prior art AlN etch mask relative to silicon.
Further, due to reduced sputtering of the ScAlN etch mask, and thus reduced micromasking, the ScAlN etch mask yielded a surface roughness of 0.6 μm compared to a surface roughness of 2.8 μm for an AlN etch mask.
The present disclosure relates to a contamination controlled semiconductor processing system.
The contamination controlled semiconductor processing system includes a processing chamber, a contamination detection system, and a contamination removal system.
The processing chamber is configured to process a wafer.
The contamination detection system is configured to determine whether a contamination level on a surface of the door is greater than a baseline level.
The contamination removal system is configured to remove contaminants from the surface of the door in response to the contamination level being greater than the baseline level.
Apparatus and methods are disclosed for sample preparation, suitable for online or offline use with multilayer samples.
