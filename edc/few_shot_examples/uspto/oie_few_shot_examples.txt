Example 1:
Text: The ScAlN etch mask is chemically nonvolatile in fluorine-based etch chemistries and has a low sputter yield, resulting in greater etch mask selectivity and reduced surface roughness for silicon and other semiconductor materials.

Example 2:
Text: The contamination detection system is configured to determine whether a contamination level on a surface of the door is greater than a baseline level.

Example 3:
Text: Thereby, reliable conducting paths are formed between intermediate layers within the ROI and a base layer, and stray current paths extending outside the ROI are eliminated, providing better quality etch progress monitoring, during subsequent etching, from body or scattered currents.

Example 4:
Text: Aluminum oxide films characterized by a dielectric constant (k) of less than about 7 (such as between about 4-6) and having a density of at least about 2.5 g/cm3 (such as about 3.0-3.2 g/cm3) are deposited on partially fabricated semiconductor devices over both metal and dielectric to serve as etch stop layers.
