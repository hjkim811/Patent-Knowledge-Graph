Example 1:
Text: The ScAlN etch mask is chemically nonvolatile in fluorine-based etch chemistries and has a low sputter yield, resulting in greater etch mask selectivity and reduced surface roughness for silicon and other semiconductor materials.
Triples: [['ScAlN etch mask', 'have', 'nonvolatile'], ['ScAlN etch mask', 'have', 'sputter yield'], ['ScAlN etch mask', 'enhance', 'etch mask selectivity'], ['ScAlN etch mask', 'diminish', 'surface roughness']]
Relations: ['diminish', 'have', 'enhance']
Answer:
diminish: The subject entity reduces or lessens the quality or degree of the object entity.
have: The subject entity possesses or exhibits the characteristic or property specified by the object entity.
enhance: The subject entity improves or increases the quality or degree of the object entity.

Example 2:
Text: The contamination detection system is configured to determine whether a contamination level on a surface of the door is greater than a baseline level.
Triples: [['contamination detection system', 'used_for', 'contamination level'], ['contamination level', 'greater_than', 'baseline_level']]
Relations: ['used_for', 'greater_than']
Answer:
used_for: The subject entity is utilized for the purpose of measuring, detecting, or evaluating the object entity.
greater_than: The subject entity exceeds or is more than the quantity or level specified by the object entity.

Example 3:
Text: Thereby, reliable conducting paths are formed between intermediate layers within the ROI and a base layer, and stray current paths extending outside the ROI are eliminated, providing better quality etch progress monitoring, during subsequent etching, from body or scattered currents.
Triples: [['conducting paths', 'located_in', 'intermediate layers'], ['conducting paths', 'located_in', 'ROI'], ['intermediate layers', 'located_in', 'ROI'], ['conducting paths', 'located_in', 'base layer'], ['stray current paths', 'removed_from', 'body'], ['stray current paths', 'removed_from', 'scattered currents'], ['stray current paths', 'enhance', 'etch progress monitoring']]
Relations: ['removed_from', 'enhance', 'located_in']
Answer:
removed_from: The subject entity is eliminated or taken away from the area or condition specified by the object entity.
enhance: The subject entity improves or increases the quality or degree of the object entity.
located_in: The subject entity is situated or found within the area or layer specified by the object entity.

Example 4:
Text: Aluminum oxide films characterized by a dielectric constant (k) of less than about 7 (such as between about 4-6) and having a density of at least about 2.5 g/cm3 (such as about 3.0-3.2 g/cm3) are deposited on partially fabricated semiconductor devices over both metal and dielectric to serve as etch stop layers.
Triples: [['Aluminum oxide films', 'have', 'dielectric constant'], ['Aluminum oxide films', 'have', 'density'], ['Aluminum oxide films', 'located_on', 'partially fabricated semiconductor devices'], ['metal', 'form', 'partially fabricated semiconductor devices'], ['dielectric', 'form', 'partially fabricated semiconductor devices'], ['Aluminum oxide films', 'used_for', 'etch stop layers']]
Relations: ['used_for', 'form', 'have', 'located_on']
Answer:
used_for: The subject entity is utilized for the purpose of measuring, detecting, or evaluating the object entity.
form: The subject entity constitutes or makes up a part of the object entity.
have: The subject entity possesses or exhibits the characteristic or property specified by the object entity.
located_on: The subject entity is deposited or situated on the surface of the object entity.

Example 5:
Text: A unique Integrated Circuit (IC) die ejection head assembly system is described, which utilizes Three-Dimensional (3D) printing to achieve very high resolution manufacturing to meet the precision tolerances required for very small IC die sizes.
Triples: [['Three-Dimensional (3D) printing', 'used_for', 'Integrated Circuit (IC) die ejection head assembly system'], ['Three-Dimensional (3D) printing', 'used_for', 'high resolution manufacturing']]
Relations: ['used_for']
Answer:
used_for: The subject entity is utilized for the purpose of measuring, detecting, or evaluating the object entity.

Example 6:
Text: The exhaust cooling apparatus includes at least one cooling plate a device for introducing turbulence to the exhaust flowing within the exhaust cooling apparatus.
Triples: [['cooling plate', 'included_in', 'exhaust cooling apparatus'], ['cooling plate', 'used_for', 'turbulence']]
Relations: ['used_for', 'included_in']
Answer:
used_for: The subject entity is utilized for the purpose of measuring, detecting, or evaluating the object entity.
included_in: The subject entity is a part or component of the object entity.
