       "'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\\nField\\nThe present invention relates to a semiconductor inspection device and relates to a semiconductor inspection device suitable for use in a collective contact type semiconductor wafer measuring device.\\nBackground\\nJP 2005-317561 A discloses a semiconductor inspection device using a probe card that can simultaneously contact a plurality of chips.\\nSemiconductor inspection device provided with a probe card which can simultaneously contact a plurality of chips needs to control many signals to inspect the plurality of chips. Thus, the semiconductor inspection device is mounted with many parts to control signals, which leads to an increase in size of the device.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe present invention has been implemented to solve the above-described problem and it is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor inspection device that can downsize the device while using a probe card that can simultaneously contact a plurality of chips.\\nThe features and advantages of the present invention may be summarized as follows.\\nAccording to the present invention, a semiconductor inspection device includes a control section that outputs a signal to inspect a semiconductor wafer, a contact section comprising contact terminals connected to the control section, a probe card that can simultaneously contact a plurality of semiconductor chips formed on the semiconductor wafer and a drive section, wherein the contact terminals can contact some of electrode pads provided for the probe card and the drive section drives the contact section so as to switch electrode pads in contact with the contact terminals.\\nOther and further objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description.\\n\\n\\n\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\\nFIG. 1 is a schematic view of a semiconductor inspection device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 2 is a schematic view of the semiconductor inspection device according to the modification of the first embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 3 is an enlarged view of a contact section and a probe card according to the modification of the first embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 4 is a schematic view of a semiconductor inspection device according to a second embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 5 is an enlarged view of a contact section and a probe card according to the second embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 6 is a schematic view of a semiconductor inspection device according to a third embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 7 is an enlarged view of a contact section and a probe card of the third embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 8 is a perspective view of the drive section and the cleaning tool according to the third embodiment of the present invention.\\n\\n\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\\nA semiconductor inspection device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Components identical or corresponding to each other are indicated by the same reference characters, and repeated description of them is avoided in some cases.\\nFirst Embodiment\\nFIG. 1 is a schematic view of a semiconductor inspection device 100 according to a first embodiment of the present invention. A semiconductor wafer 10 is placed on a top surface of a chuck stage 12. Semiconductor chips 34 are formed on the semiconductor wafer 10. A probe card 16 is disposed above the semiconductor wafer 10. The probe card 16 is fixed by a probe card support section 14. The probe card 16 is provided with contact probes 18 to contact the semiconductor chips 34. The contact probes 18 are made up of standing needles so as to be able to simultaneously contact all the semiconductor chips 34 formed on the semiconductor wafer 10. The probe card 16 includes electrode pads 20 on a top surface thereof. The respective contact probes 18 are connected to their corresponding electrode pads 20. Note that in FIG. 1, two contact probes 18 are connected to one electrode pad 20, but the number of contact probes connected is not limited to this. The number of contact probes 18 connected to each electrode pad 20 is one of design factors.\\nA contact section 22 is disposed above the probe card 16. The contact section 22 is supported by a drive section 26. The contact section 22 is provided with contact terminals 24. The contact terminals 24 are provided so as to be able to simultaneously contact the electrode pads 20 for measuring one of the semiconductor chips 34. The drive section 26 drives the contact section 22 in the X-, Y- and Z-axis directions. Note that the X-axis and Z-axis are coordinate axes shown in FIG. 1. The Y-axis is a coordinate axis perpendicular to the X-axis and Z-axis. The drive section 26 can drive the contact section 22 to rotate around the Z-axis.\\nThe contact terminals 24 are connected to a test head 30 via the contact section 22, a connection section 28 and a signal line 31. The chuck stage 12 is connected to the test head 30 via a connection section 29 and a signal line 33. The test head 30 is connected to a control section 32 via a signal line 35. The test head 30 is a mechanism for connecting the signal lines 31, 33 and 35 between the contact terminals 24 and the control section 32, and between the chuck stage 12 and the control section 32. The control section 32 is a body part of a semiconductor tester and outputs a signal to inspect the semiconductor wafer 10.\\nThe chuck stage 12, the probe card support section 14 and the probe card 16 constitute a wafer prober. The contact section 22, the drive section 26, the signal lines 31, 33 and 35, the connection sections 28 and 29, the test head 30 and the control section 32 constitute a semiconductor tester.\\nDuring an inspection, the semiconductor wafer 10 is placed on a top surface of the chuck stage 12. Next, the wafer prober causes the semiconductor wafer 10 to contact the probe card 16. At this time, the semiconductor chips 34 contact the contact probes 18 so that all the semiconductor chips 34 formed on the semiconductor wafer 10 can be measured. Next, the drive section 26 drives the contact section 22. As a result, the contact terminals 24 contact the electrode pads 20 to measure one of the semiconductor chips 34.\\nA conduction path for measuring electric characteristics of the semiconductor wafer 10 is formed in this way. The conduction path is formed in order of the top surface of the semiconductor wafer 10 as a starting point, the contact probes 18, the electrode pads 20, the contact terminals 24, the connection section 28, the signal line 31, the test head 30, the signal line 33, the connection section 29, the chuck stage 12, and the reverse side of the semiconductor wafer 10. Furthermore, the conduction path is formed in order of the test head 30, the signal line 35 and the control section 32. Note that as the conduction path, a case is assumed in the present embodiment where the semiconductor chip 34 is a longitudinal semiconductor such as an IGBT. As a modification of the present embodiment, the semiconductor chip 34 may be a horizontal semiconductor. In this case, signals may not need to be extracted from the reverse side of the wafer.\\nWhen measurement of one measurement chip is completed, the drive section 26 drives the contact section 22 to move. As a result, the contact terminals 24 contact the electrode pads 20 corresponding to the next measurement chip. In this case, the semiconductor wafer 10 and the contact probes 18 are kept in contact with each other. Therefore, it is possible to switch between measurement chips with the semiconductor wafer 10 and the contact probe 18 being kept in contact with each other.\\nWhen a semiconductor inspection device is constructed using a probe card which can simultaneously contact a plurality of semiconductor chips, a method may be considered which simultaneously connects the control section to all the electrode pads provided for the probe card. At this time, the semiconductor inspection device needs to control many signals. For this reason, the test head which is a signal connection mechanism needs to be provided with many relays to switch between signals. This results in an increase in the size of the device. Since the test head is provided with many relays, when trouble occurs in the relays, it is difficult to identify the trouble location.\\nIn contrast, in the present embodiment, it is one semiconductor chip 34 that is measured by single contact between the contact terminals 24 and the electrode pads 20. Thus, the test head 30 is only required to be able to process signals to measure one chip. Therefore, the device can be constructed of fewer parts than when all the electrode pads 20 provided for the probe card 16 and the control section 32 are connected. For this reason, the semiconductor inspection device 100 can be downsized. Furthermore, when trouble occurs in the device, it is easier to identify the trouble location. The semiconductor inspection device 100 can also be constructed at lower cost.\\nAnother method for downsizing the semiconductor inspection device may be use of a type of small probe card that contacts only one chip at a time. In this case, the semiconductor wafer and the probe card contact each other repeatedly for each chip so that measurement chips can be switched. When the semiconductor wafer and the probe card contact each other, surface heat of the semiconductor wafer is absorbed to the contact probe side. Therefore, the temperature of the wafer surface changes and a characteristic value varies. To prevent a variation in the characteristic value, a waiting time may be provided to make temperature stable for each contact. Providing a waiting time every time one chip is measured would increase the testing time.\\nIn contrast, in the present embodiment, the contact section 22 moves, and measurement chips are thereby switched. When the measurement chips are switched, contact between the semiconductor wafer 10 and the probe card 16 is maintained. Therefore, when the measurement chips are switched, variations in an air flow and heat balance in space nearby the semiconductor wafer 10 are suppressed. Thus, the temperature variation of the semiconductor wafer 10 is suppressed. In this way, it is possible to shorten the waiting time for temperature stabilization. Therefore, the testing time can be shortened.\\nSince the temperature variation of the semiconductor wafer 10 is suppressed, it is possible to simplify a temperature adjustment function provided for the chuck stage 12. Therefore, the device can be downsized. Moreover, since the temperature variation of the semiconductor wafer 10 is suppressed, the characteristic value is stabilized. Therefore, the measuring accuracy can be improved. Moreover, when the measurement chips are switched by changing the position of the semiconductor wafer 10 for each chip, high contact accuracy is required. In contrast, in the present embodiment, the measurement chips can be switched by moving the small contact section 22. Therefore, the contact accuracy can be relaxed.\\nAs the contact terminal 24 in the present embodiment, a spring probe, a wire probe, a laminated probe, a cantilever type probe or a ball grid can be used. Use of the spring probe or the cantilever type probe allows the contact terminal 24 to be configured at low cost. Use of the wire probe or the laminated probe allows the contact terminal 24 to have a longer service life. Use of the laminated probe allows the current flowing through the contact terminal 24 to have a higher current density. Use of the ball grid relaxes the contact accuracy required for contact between the contact terminal 24 and the electrode pad 20. In addition, any terminal can be used as the contact terminal 24 as long as it can secure conductivity through contact with the electrode pad 20.\\nThe present embodiment assumes that one chip is measured by single contact between the contact terminals 24 and the electrode pads 20. As a modification thereof, a plurality of chips may be measured by single contact. In the present modification, the contact terminals 24 simultaneously contact the electrode pads 20 for measuring the plurality of semiconductor chips 34 to be measured. During measurement, measuring circuits are switched by a relay provided for the test head 30 to measure the plurality of chips.\\nThe number of chips measured by single contact between the contact terminals 24 and the electrode pads 20 may be any number as long as the chips are some of the semiconductor chips 34. Note that when the number of chips measured by single contact is 4 or less, a commercially available product can be used as the test head 30 and the semiconductor inspection device 100 can be constructed at low cost. According to the present modification, it is possible to reduce the number of times measurement chips are switched and shorten the testing time.\\nIn the present embodiment, it is assumed that the probe card 16 can simultaneously contact all the semiconductor chips 34 formed on the semiconductor wafer 10. As a modification thereof, the probe card 16 may simultaneously contact some of the semiconductor chips 34. In the present modification, it is possible to reduce the size of the probe card 16 compared to the case where the probe card 16 can simultaneously contact all the semiconductor chips 34.\\nFIG. 2 is a schematic view of the semiconductor inspection device according to the modification of the first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of a contact section and a probe card according to the modification of the first embodiment of the present invention. In the semiconductor inspection device 100, the contact section 22 and the test head 30 are configured to be independent of each other. In contrast, in the semiconductor inspection device 200 of the present modification, a test head 230 is provided in a contact section 222. The contact section 222 and the test head 230 are integrated into one unit. Therefore, the drive section 226 drives the test head 230 together with the contact section 222.\\nAccording to the present modification, the contact section 222 and the test head 230 need not be provided separately. Therefore, the device configuration is simplified. In the present modification, it is assumed that the contact section 222 and the test head 230 are integrated into one unit. In contrast, the test head 230 may be detachably fixed to the contact section 222. Furthermore, in the present modification, the contact terminal 224 may be provided in the test head 230.\\nSecond Embodiment\\nFIG. 4 is a schematic view of a semiconductor inspection device according to a second embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 5 is an enlarged view of a contact section and a probe card according to the second embodiment of the present invention. A semiconductor inspection device 300 of the present embodiment is provided with a contact section 322. The contact section 322 is provided with a cylindrical roller 336. Contact terminals 324 are provided on a surface of the roller 336. A drive section 326 drives the roller 336 to rotate. In the present embodiment, as the roller 336 rotates, the electrode pads 20 that contact the contact terminals 324 are switched. Therefore, measurement chips are switched as the roller 336 rotates.\\nIn the first embodiment, the following procedure is executed to switch between measurement chips. First, the contact section 22 is lifted so as to separate it away from the electrode pads 20. Next, the contact section 22 is moved to above the electrode pads 20 corresponding to the next measurement chip. Next, the contact section 22 is lowered so as to contact the electrode pads 20 again. In contrast, in the present embodiment, measurement chips are switched as the roller 336 rotates. It is thereby possible to shorten the time of switching measurement chips. In the present embodiment, the contact terminal 324 is a ball grid.\\nThird Embodiment\\nFIG. 6 is a schematic view of a semiconductor inspection device according to a third embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 7 is an enlarged view of a contact section and a probe card of the third embodiment of the present invention. The semiconductor inspection device 400 according to the present embodiment is provided with a cleaning tool 438 to clean the surface of the contact terminals 324 or the electrode pads 20. The cleaning tool 438 of the present embodiment is provided with a brush. As the material of the brush, resin or metal can be used.\\nFIG. 8 is a perspective view of the drive section and the cleaning tool according to the third embodiment of the present invention. The brush is disposed above the roller 336. As the roller 336 rotates, the contact terminals 324 are cleaned with the brush. In addition to the brush, a probe card polishing sheet, an absorption tape, an air cutter or a wipe can be used as the cleaning tool 438. In addition, any tool can be used as long as it can clean the surface. Furthermore, the cleaning tool 438 is provided with a dust collection nozzle 440.\\nThe surfaces of the contact terminals 324 or the electrode pads 20 are cleaned with the cleaning tool 438. This can prevent contact failures between the contact terminals 324 and the electrode pads 20. The dust collection nozzle 440 absorbs dust generated by cleaning. The device can thereby be kept clean. As a modification of the present embodiment, the brush may be disposed on a side face of the roller 336. In this case, the dust collection nozzle 440 is disposed beneath the brush or the roller 336. According to this configuration, the dust collection nozzle 440 can collect dust generated by cleaning so as to receive dust below the brush or the roller 336. Dust can thereby be efficiently collected.\\nIn the present embodiment, the semiconductor inspection device 400 is provided with the contact section 322. In contrast, the semiconductor inspection device 400 may also be provided with the contact section 22 or the contact section 222 shown in the first embodiment.\\nAs shown in FIG. 8, the drive section 326 is provided with an X-axis drive section 326a, a Y-axis drive section 326b, a Z-axis drive section 326c and a θ-axis drive section 326d. The X-axis drive section 326a drives the contact section 322 in the X-axis direction. The Y-axis drive section 326b drives the contact section 322 in the Y-axis direction. The Z-axis drive section 326c drives the contact section 322 in the Z-axis direction. The θ-axis drive section 326d causes the contact section 322 to rotate around the Z-axis. The X-, Y- and Z-axes are coordinate axes shown in FIG. 8. As the drive section 326 drives the contact section 322 to move in the X, Y- and Z-axis directions and rotate around the Z-axis, the drive section 326 causes the electrode pads 20 and the contact terminals 324 to contact each other. The configuration shown in FIG. 8 is an example of the drive section 326 and the configuration of the drive section 326 is not limited to this. Note that the configuration of the drive section 326 is also applicable to the drive sections 26 and 226 shown in the first embodiment.\\nAccording to the wafer inspection device of the present invention, the contact terminals contact part of the electrode pads provided for the probe card, whereby the control section and the probe card are conductively connected. Furthermore, the drive section switches the electrode pads that contact the contact terminals. This configuration requires fewer signals for performing processing by single contact than a configuration in which the control section is connected to all the electrode pads provided for the probe card. Therefore, the device can be constructed of fewer parts. The size of the device can thereby be reduced.\\nObviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.\\nThe entire disclosure of a Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-100424, filed on May 19, 2016 including specification, claims, drawings and summary, on which the Convention priority of the present application is based, are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.'"

      "Recently, the high integration of semiconductors has increased the processing and storage capacity of information per unit area. This has led to demands for large diameter semiconductor wafers, miniaturization of circuit line width, and multilayer wiring. In order to form a multi-layered wiring on a semiconductor wafer, high-level flatness of the wafer is required, and a wafer flattening process is required for such high-level flatness.\n",
      "One of the wafer flattening processes is a wafer polishing process. The wafer polishing process is a step of polishing the upper and lower surfaces of the wafer with a polishing pad. The wafer polishing process is carried out using a polishing system having a polishing unit provided with an upper plate, a lower plate and a means for supplying polishing slurry to the polishing unit.\n",
      "A pipe connected to the polishing unit for supplying the slurry to the polishing unit may be provided in the polishing system. However, the abrasive grains contained in the slurry may be adhered to the inside of the pipe to clog the pipe.\n",
      "Furthermore, when such adhered slurry falls off and flows into the polishing unit, it may cause damage to the object to be polished and the polishing unit. Therefore, a solution to this problem is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "With an increase in the degree of integration of semiconductor devices, variation in the height of structures formed on a semiconductor wafer is increasing. In the case where such height variation is high, it is difficult to accurately print a mask pattern due to problems related to DOF (Depth Of Focus) in a subsequent lithography process.\n",
      "Thus, in order to flatten the surface of a wafer, chemical-mechanical polishing (hereinafter referred to as “CMP”), in which chemical removal processing and mechanical removal processing are combined into a single process, is widely utilized these days.\n",
      "Typically, a CMP process is performed in a manner in which a wafer surface having varying height is brought into close contact with a polishing pad, and a slurry, serving as a polishing liquid containing an abrasive and a chemical material, is then injected between the wafer and the polishing pad to thus flatten the surface of the wafer. Briefly, CMP is a process of flattening a semiconductor wafer through removal of a certain film therefrom, and in the CMP process, the uniformity of the polished surface after the polishing is regarded as very important.\n",
      "The construction for CMP includes a head to which a wafer is mounted, a pad rotating in the same direction, and a slurry containing nano-sized polishing particles therebetween, the wafer being mounted to the head by means of surface tension or a vacuum. In the CMP process, a wafer is polished by the pad and the slurry, and a polishing table equipped with the pad performs a simple rotational motion and the head part simultaneously performs both rotational motion and oscillatory motion and presses the wafer toward the polishing table with a predetermined pressure. The wafer surface and the pad come into contact with each other due to the self-load of the head part and the applied pressure, and the slurry, which is the processing liquid, is allowed to flow into fine gaps between the contact surfaces, that is, into pores in the pad. A mechanical removal process is performed by the polishing particles in the slurry and the surface projections of the pad, and a chemical removal process is conducted by the chemical component in the slurry. Also, polishing particles or surface projections come into contact with top of the protruding portion of the wafer on which the device is formed, and pressure is intensively applied to the protruding portion, and thus the protruding portion has a relatively high surface removal rate compared to the other portions. As the processing progresses, protruding portions are uniformly removed over the entire area. During the flattening process, polishing has to be stopped at the layer where a silicon oxide film appears. The CMP process may be classified into a process type in which only the same material is polished during the processing to thus remove only a predetermined thickness and a process type in which a polishing end point is determined while coming into contact with a different kind of material. In the case where the polishing rate of a layer that must not be polished is significantly lower than the polishing rate of a material to be polished during the processing, the polishing end point (PEP) may be naturally determined due to slight over-polishing. Here, the polishing ratio of two materials is referred to as a selectivity ratio. The slurry used in the CMP process is configured such that an abrasive that realizes a predetermined selectivity ratio should be mixed with a solution in an atmosphere that may cause a chemical reaction. Specifically, during the damascene process, there is required a slurry, in which the polishing ratio of two materials is different, that is, the selectivity ratio is different, in a manner in which a silicon nitride film is preferentially polished and polishing is stopped at the time that a silicon oxide film being exposed. Furthermore, there is required a slurry, which causes no damage to a metal layer and improves the electrical properties of a device. However, conventionally developed slurry cannot be used in the damascene gate process because the polishing rate of a silicon oxide film is much higher than that of a silicon nitride film. The effectiveness of the CMP process depends mainly on the properties of the slurry, so the development of an optimal slurry composition for CMP is required.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the surface to be polished during CMP exposes various kinds of materials, such as a polysilicon film (polycrystalline silicon film), a monocrystalline silicon film, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, etc. Conventionally, a slurry composition for CMP, which is targeted to any one of the above materials, is used to remove the target material through CMP. However, when the polishing rate of the target material is significantly different from that of another material, the target material is excessively polished, undesirably causing defects such as dishing or erosion. Also, since the processing is carried out in a manner in which a CMP slurry composition suitable for each of the target materials is selected and a removal process is performed through CMP, productivity is lowered, which is undesirable.\n",
      "With the recent diversification of the structure of semiconductor devices, three kinds of films, namely a polysilicon film, a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film, are required to be simultaneously polished. In order to simultaneously polish the three kinds of films, it is necessary to develop a slurry composition, which may perform a polishing process by adjusting the selectivity ratio of the films with the slurry composition alone for CMP, apart from the steps of selecting a slurry suitable for each polishing target and supplying the slurry.\n",
      "Regarding techniques capable of performing a polishing process by adjusting the selectivity ratio of the films with the slurry composition alone for CMP, Korean Patent No. 1396853 discloses ┌Slurry composition for polishing silicon nitride, method of polishing silicon nitride film using the same, and method of manufacturing semiconductor device┘, in which the slurry composition for polishing silicon nitride enables a silicon nitride film to be polished at a high polishing selectivity ratio relative to a silicon oxide film, and may thus be efficiently applied to the process of manufacturing a semiconductor, which requires selective removal of the silicon nitride film. Also, Korean Patent Application Publication No. 2014-0133604 discloses ⇄CMP composition selective for oxide and nitride having high removal rate and low defectivity┘, in which the CMP composition is composed of a ceria abrasive, one or more nonionic polymers, optionally one or more phosphonic acids, optionally one or more nitrogen-containing zwitterionic compounds, optionally one or more sulfonic acid copolymers, optionally one or more anionic copolymers, optionally one or more polymers comprising quaternary amines, optionally one or more compounds that adjust the pH of the polishing composition, water, and optionally one or more additives, thus exhibiting preferable selectivity of silicon oxide, silicon nitride and/or polysilicon. Also, the method of chemically and mechanically polishing a substrate including silicon oxide, silicon nitride and/or polysilicon using the above CMP composition is disclosed.\n",
      "Therefore, the present invention is aimed to a slurry composition for CMP, which enables polishing by adjusting the selectivity ratio of the films through control of amounts of an additive and a solvent, without the need to use a separate slurry suitable for each film (a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film and a polysilicon film) depending on the polishing target.\n",

      "Such a CVD reactor is described in JP 2002-146540 A. The substrate holder has a pocket formed by a depression, which has a further depression in its middle zone. The substrate rests on the edge step thus formed, which is raised in relation to the central zone of the base of the pocket. A heater, which is spaced apart from the bottom side of the substrate holder by a gap, is located underneath the substrate holder. The heater consists of multiple circumferential sections, which are spaced apart from one another by depressions. The bottom side of the substrate holder has a depression in a central region lying under a middle zone of the pocket, so that the gap height of the insulation gap is greater there than in a circumferential region surrounding this central region. A central heating element, using which the central region can be heated, lies underneath the central region. Spaced apart therefrom in the radial direction by a gap, a further heating element surrounding the first heating element is located, which can separately heat the surrounding region.\n",
      "EP 0 160 220 B2 describes a substrate holder, in which the substrates also only rest on one edge of a pocket.\n",
      "US 2011/0049779 A1 is concerned with the problem that substrates, which are coated in a CVD reactor with different layers at different temperatures, can curve as a result of different properties of the layers. For example, if a layer having a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than the substrate is deposited on the substrate in the coating process and the substrate is brought to a lower temperature or brought to a higher temperature in a following process step, the substrate curves in one direction or the other direction. Since the substrate is only supported on selected support regions and in particular only at the edge and otherwise extends freely over the base of the pocket, it is essentially heated by heat conduction via the gas between substrate and pocket base. In the case of a curve upward, the gas gap enlarges in the middle region, so that less heat is transported to the substrate there, with the consequence that the surface of the substrate has a lower temperature there than in the edge region. This has the consequence that the electrically—or optically—active layers deposited on the substrate have different properties from one another laterally. These inhomogeneities are very disadvantageous in particular in the manufacturing of light-emitting diodes and therein in the manufacturing of MQW (multi-quantum wall).\n",
      "DE 10 2006 018 514 A1 describes a substrate holder, in which a rotationally-driven carrier, which can respectively carry one or multiple substrates, lies in each of a plurality of pockets. The substrates lie on the top side of the rotatable carrier. The rotatable carrier is mounted on a gas cushion. The gas forming the gas cushion can have various thermal conductivities. A recess is located in the bottom side of the carrier, so that the gas cushion between the base of the pocket and the bottom side of the carrier has zones of various gap heights. By variation of the thermal conductivity of the gas, the temperature profile on the top side of the carrier and therefore the substrate temperature can be locally influenced.\n",

      "Description of the Related Art\n",
      "The semiconductor industry has progressed according to Moore's Law for the last fifty years. Moore's Law roughly holds that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Inherent in this law is that the progression of transistor density is two-dimensional, and that at some point physics imposes a limit on how small devices can be.\n",
      "Recently, manufacturers have developed processes that extend device structures into the third dimension to increase processing capability. Such devices generally feature large numbers of films deposited sequentially on a substrate. In some cases, over 100 films may be formed. When measuring film thickness or other properties in conventional reflectometry, properties of the substrate underneath the film being measured are needed for calculating the properties of the film being measured. Thus, conventional reflectometry only functions properly when the substrate underneath is fully known. For example, when the substrate underneath is a bare silicon wafer, or a silicon wafer with a known stack of blanket films.\n",
      "However, in semiconductor processing, processing chambers are usually used for depositing films on various substrates. Furthermore, films are usually deposited on substrates with a patterned surface. Even if the pattern is known, the point being measured may not fall in the same region of the pattern for each substrate being measured.\n",
      "Therefore, there is a need for apparatus and methods for measuring properties of films formed on substrate locations having unknown surface properties.\n",

      "Semiconductor inspection device provided with a probe card which can simultaneously contact a plurality of chips needs to control many signals to inspect the plurality of chips. Thus, the semiconductor inspection device is mounted with many parts to control signals, which leads to an increase in size of the device.\n",

      "Measuring current in a power supply is an important consideration in the design and implementation of modern power supplies. A current sense function may be used for fault detection and/or protection, for current-mode controlled voltage regulation, and for current control, among other uses. Over the years, a variety of systems have been used to measure current in a power supply, including, for example, discrete resistors, use of a resistance inherent to traces of printed circuit boards, use of resistance inherent to an integrated circuit lead frame, use of inductors, magnetic sensing devices including coils, transformers and Hall effect sensors, and use of a drain-source resistance of a power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET).\n",
      "One of the leading systems to measure current in a power supply uses a dedicated field effect transistor (FET) known as or referred to as a “sense-FET.” Generally, a sense-FET is small a FET, separate from the main power FET, referred to herein as the “main-FET.” Generally, a sense-FET is configured to produce a voltage corresponding to the current in the main-FET. The “current sense ratio” (CSR) is a figure of merit of the implementation of the sense-FET. The current sense ratio is a ratio of current in the main-FET to current in the sense-FET, e.g., Imain/Isense. A higher current sense ratio is generally desirable, so that the range of current sensing is extended over many decades of current in the main-FET. However, increasing CSR has been a challenge due to, for example, complex interactions between sense-FET structures and main-FET structures.\n",
      "Conventional approaches to design and implementation of sense-FETs have not been found to be applicable to Split Gate Charge Balanced (SGCB) trench MOSFETs. A split gate device includes multiple layers of polysilicon in the trenches with different electrical voltages, and it has a special structure and layout to establish the proper charge balance. For example, the trenches are spaced a certain distance apart to establish a charge balance, and furthermore, any active body junction in the device must be properly surrounded by polysilicon shields that establish the charge balance.\n",

      "As integrated circuits (ICs) become increasingly smaller and faster, electrical signals used in various types of ICs are also subject to increasing delays caused by capacitance, inductance, or resistance in the ICs. At a certain high speed and/or frequency, such delays become a design concern. To avoid potential signal delay issues, optical signals are used instead of electrical signals for data transmission in some situations.\n",

      "The present invention relates to compositions and, in particular, antireflective coating compositions for use in microelectronic application In a preferred aspect, compositions of the invention comprise 1) one or more glycidyl groups; and 2) one or more aromatic groups that each comprises two or more substituents that comprise hydroxy, thiol and/or amine moieties. Preferred compositions of the invention are used with an overcoated photoresist composition and may be referred to as bottom antireflective compositions or “BARCs”.\n",
      "Photoresists are photosensitive films used for the transfer of images to a substrate. A coating layer of a photoresist is formed on a substrate and the photoresist layer is then exposed through a photomask to a source of activating radiation. Following exposure, the photoresist is developed to provide a relief image that permits selective processing of a substrate.\n",
      "Reflection of activating radiation used to expose a photoresist often poses limits on resolution of the image patterned in the photoresist layer. Reflection of radiation from the substrate/photoresist interface can produce spatial variations in the radiation intensity in the photoresist, resulting in non-uniform photoresist linewidth upon development. Radiation also can scatter from the substrate/photoresist interface into regions of the photoresist where exposure is non-intended, again resulting in linewidth variations.\n",
      "One approach used to reduce the problem of reflected radiation has been the use of a radiation absorbing layer (antireflective composition layer) interposed between the substrate surface and the photoresist coating layer. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,338,078; 6,927,0152; 5,677,112; 8,481,247; 8,012,670; 6,818,381; and 7,846,638; WO067329A1; and EP2000852.\n",
      "SiO2, TiN and other metals are common substrates on which photoresist and antireflective compositions are coated. Silicon oxynitride (SiON) layers and other inorganics such as Si3N4 coatings have been employed in semiconductor device manufacture, for example as an etch stop layer and an inorganic antireflective layer. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,124,217; 6,153,504; and 6,245,682.\n",
      "Dry etching is a frequently preferred of pattern transfer with a photoresist relief image. The plasma used however in a dry etch process can cause damage to thin oxide and nitride layers, such as may be employed in flash memory fabrication. As a consequence, wet etching is often used for pattern transfer trough such more fragile substrates due to relatively milder condition of wet etch processes.\n",
      "Wet etching of metal nitrides, such as titanium nitride (TiN), has been carried out using either an aqueous mixture of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide, or a mixture of an acid such as sulfuric acid and a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide. See, for instance, US 2006/0226122.\n",
      "A problem with such using conventional wet etchants is their lack of selectivity. These wet etchants often attack surrounding structures, resulting in either etching or, particularly in the case of some photoresists, swelling and/or loss of adhesion to substrates to which the photoresist is applied. Such lack of selectivity becomes increasingly less acceptable as critical dimensions continue to be reduced.\n",
      "It thus would be desirable to have new antireflective compositions for use with an overcoated photoresist. It would be particularly desirable to have new antireflective compositions that exhibit enhanced performance and could provide increased resolution of an image patterned into an overcoated photoresist. It also would be desirable to have new antireflective compositions for application onto metal substrate surfaces and that would provide good resolution and metal substrate adherence including through a wet etching process.\n",

      "Such a CVD reactor is described in JP 2002-146540 A. The substrate holder has a pocket formed by a depression, which has a further depression in its middle zone. The substrate rests on the edge step thus formed, which is raised in relation to the central zone of the base of the pocket. A heater, which is spaced apart from the bottom side of the substrate holder by a gap, is located underneath the substrate holder. The heater consists of multiple circumferential sections, which are spaced apart from one another by depressions. The bottom side of the substrate holder has a depression in a central region lying under a middle zone of the pocket, so that the gap height of the insulation gap is greater there than in a circumferential region surrounding this central region. A central heating element, using which the central region can be heated, lies underneath the central region. Spaced apart therefrom in the radial direction by a gap, a further heating element surrounding the first heating element is located, which can separately heat the surrounding region.\n",
      "EP 0 160 220 B2 describes a substrate holder, in which the substrates also only rest on one edge of a pocket.\n",
      "US 2011/0049779 A1 is concerned with the problem that substrates, which are coated in a CVD reactor with different layers at different temperatures, can curve as a result of different properties of the layers. For example, if a layer having a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than the substrate is deposited on the substrate in the coating process and the substrate is brought to a lower temperature or brought to a higher temperature in a following process step, the substrate curves in one direction or the other direction. Since the substrate is only supported on selected support regions and in particular only at the edge and otherwise extends freely over the base of the pocket, it is essentially heated by heat conduction via the gas between substrate and pocket base. In the case of a curve upward, the gas gap enlarges in the middle region, so that less heat is transported to the substrate there, with the consequence that the surface of the substrate has a lower temperature there than in the edge region. This has the consequence that the electrically—or optically—active layers deposited on the substrate have different properties from one another laterally. These inhomogeneities are very disadvantageous in particular in the manufacturing of light-emitting diodes and therein in the manufacturing of MQW (multi-quantum wall).\n",
      "DE 10 2006 018 514 A1 describes a substrate holder, in which a rotationally-driven carrier, which can respectively carry one or multiple substrates, lies in each of a plurality of pockets. The substrates lie on the top side of the rotatable carrier. The rotatable carrier is mounted on a gas cushion. The gas forming the gas cushion can have various thermal conductivities. A recess is located in the bottom side of the carrier, so that the gas cushion between the base of the pocket and the bottom side of the carrier has zones of various gap heights. By variation of the thermal conductivity of the gas, the temperature profile on the top side of the carrier and therefore the substrate temperature can be locally influenced.\n",

      "The semiconductor industry has progressed according to Moore's Law for the last fifty years. Moore's Law roughly holds that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Inherent in this law is that the progression of transistor density is two-dimensional, and that at some point physics imposes a limit on how small devices can be.\n",
      "Recently, manufacturers have developed processes that extend device structures into the third dimension to increase processing capability. Such devices generally feature large numbers of films deposited sequentially on a substrate. In some cases, over 100 films may be formed. When measuring film thickness or other properties in conventional reflectometry, properties of the substrate underneath the film being measured are needed for calculating the properties of the film being measured. Thus, conventional reflectometry only functions properly when the substrate underneath is fully known. For example, when the substrate underneath is a bare silicon wafer, or a silicon wafer with a known stack of blanket films.\n",
      "However, in semiconductor processing, processing chambers are usually used for depositing films on various substrates. Furthermore, films are usually deposited on substrates with a patterned surface. Even if the pattern is known, the point being measured may not fall in the same region of the pattern for each substrate being measured.\n",
      "Therefore, there is a need for apparatus and methods for measuring properties of films formed on substrate locations having unknown surface properties.\n",

      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Measuring current in a power supply is an important consideration in the design and implementation of modern power supplies. A current sense function may be used for fault detection and/or protection, for current-mode controlled voltage regulation, and for current control, among other uses. Over the years, a variety of systems have been used to measure current in a power supply, including, for example, discrete resistors, use of a resistance inherent to traces of printed circuit boards, use of resistance inherent to an integrated circuit lead frame, use of inductors, magnetic sensing devices including coils, transformers and Hall effect sensors, and use of a drain-source resistance of a power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET).\n",
      "One of the leading systems to measure current in a power supply uses a dedicated field effect transistor (FET) known as or referred to as a “sense-FET.” Generally, a sense-FET is small a FET, separate from the main power FET, referred to herein as the “main-FET.” Generally, a sense-FET is configured to produce a voltage corresponding to the current in the main-FET. The “current sense ratio” (CSR) is a figure of merit of the implementation of the sense-FET. The current sense ratio is a ratio of current in the main-FET to current in the sense-FET, e.g., Imain/Isense. A higher current sense ratio is generally desirable, so that the range of current sensing is extended over many decades of current in the main-FET. However, increasing CSR has been a challenge due to, for example, complex interactions between sense-FET structures and main-FET structures.\n",
      "Conventional approaches to design and implementation of sense-FETs have not been found to be applicable to Split Gate Charge Balanced (SGCB) trench MOSFETs. A split gate device includes multiple layers of polysilicon in the trenches with different electrical voltages, and it has a special structure and layout to establish the proper charge balance. For example, the trenches are spaced a certain distance apart to establish a charge balance, and furthermore, any active body junction in the device must be properly surrounded by polysilicon shields that establish the charge balance.\n",

To avoid potential signal delay issues, optical signals are used instead of electrical signals for data transmission in some situations.\n",

      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "The present invention relates to compositions and, in particular, antireflective coating compositions for use in microelectronic application In a preferred aspect, compositions of the invention comprise 1) one or more glycidyl groups; and 2) one or more aromatic groups that each comprises two or more substituents that comprise hydroxy, thiol and/or amine moieties. Preferred compositions of the invention are used with an overcoated photoresist composition and may be referred to as bottom antireflective compositions or “BARCs”.\n",
      "Photoresists are photosensitive films used for the transfer of images to a substrate. A coating layer of a photoresist is formed on a substrate and the photoresist layer is then exposed through a photomask to a source of activating radiation. Following exposure, the photoresist is developed to provide a relief image that permits selective processing of a substrate.\n",
      "Reflection of activating radiation used to expose a photoresist often poses limits on resolution of the image patterned in the photoresist layer. Reflection of radiation from the substrate/photoresist interface can produce spatial variations in the radiation intensity in the photoresist, resulting in non-uniform photoresist linewidth upon development. Radiation also can scatter from the substrate/photoresist interface into regions of the photoresist where exposure is non-intended, again resulting in linewidth variations.\n",
      "One approach used to reduce the problem of reflected radiation has been the use of a radiation absorbing layer (antireflective composition layer) interposed between the substrate surface and the photoresist coating layer. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,338,078; 6,927,0152; 5,677,112; 8,481,247; 8,012,670; 6,818,381; and 7,846,638; WO067329A1; and EP2000852.\n",
      "SiO2, TiN and other metals are common substrates on which photoresist and antireflective compositions are coated. Silicon oxynitride (SiON) layers and other inorganics such as Si3N4 coatings have been employed in semiconductor device manufacture, for example as an etch stop layer and an inorganic antireflective layer. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,124,217; 6,153,504; and 6,245,682.\n",
      "Dry etching is a frequently preferred of pattern transfer with a photoresist relief image. The plasma used however in a dry etch process can cause damage to thin oxide and nitride layers, such as may be employed in flash memory fabrication. As a consequence, wet etching is often used for pattern transfer trough such more fragile substrates due to relatively milder condition of wet etch processes.\n",
      "Wet etching of metal nitrides, such as titanium nitride (TiN), has been carried out using either an aqueous mixture of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide, or a mixture of an acid such as sulfuric acid and a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide. See, for instance, US 2006/0226122.\n",
      "A problem with such using conventional wet etchants is their lack of selectivity. These wet etchants often attack surrounding structures, resulting in either etching or, particularly in the case of some photoresists, swelling and/or loss of adhesion to substrates to which the photoresist is applied. Such lack of selectivity becomes increasingly less acceptable as critical dimensions continue to be reduced.\n",
      "It thus would be desirable to have new antireflective compositions for use with an overcoated photoresist. It would be particularly desirable to have new antireflective compositions that exhibit enhanced performance and could provide increased resolution of an image patterned into an overcoated photoresist. It also would be desirable to have new antireflective compositions for application onto metal substrate surfaces and that would provide good resolution and metal substrate adherence including through a wet etching process.\n",

      "The present invention relates to the manufacturing equipment in semiconductor industry, especially to a device of changing the gas flow pattern in the process chamber and a wafer processing method and apparatus.\n",
      "RELATED ART\n",
      "The silicon etching is dominated by the chemical action, the gas delivery and flow pattern in the process chamber of etching apparatus will significantly affect the etching performance. A gas center ring (GCR), which is employed in the process chamber for silicon etching, can change the gas flow pattern in the process chamber according to the specific requirements of different etching processes.\n",
      "As shown in FIG. 1, the etching apparatus comprises a process chamber 300, and a wafer 500 placed on a base 400 at bottom of the process chamber 300; during the processing, an electrostatic chuck 410 (or called ESC) on top of the base 400 will support the wafer 500, and the gas introduced into the process chamber 300 will etch or conduct other processing on the wafer 500 surface. A dielectric lid set on the top of the chamber sidewall, a RF coil connect to a RF power source and fixed upon said lid, so as to deliver the RF power into the process chamber and form plasma. If no gas center ring is equipped in the process chamber 300, after the gas is horizontally introduced from the inlet 600 which is located at upper portion of side wall of the process chamber 300, most gas will directly flow downwards along the side wall of the process chamber 300 and less gas will flow towards to the space above the wafer 500.\n",
      "In contract, as shown in FIG. 2, the gas center ring 100 in the process chamber 300 is an annular structure which located under the inlet 600 and above the wafer 500; the gas is horizontally introduced from the inlet 600 and firstly horizontally flows to the central opening of the gas center ring 100 along the upper surface of the gas center ring 100, and then is delivered downwards to the corresponding wafer 500 surface under the central opening.\n",
      "The most important parameters of the gas center ring to adjust the gas flow and etching effect are the central opening diameter of the gas center ring and the height between the gas center ring and the wafer surface. For example, the gas center ring with smaller opening diameter will promote the gas to flow to the position corresponding to the wafer central area; while the gas center ring with larger opening diameter, more gas will flow to the position corresponding to the wafer edge area.\n",
      "The gas center ring adjusts the reactant distribution form in the process chamber (for example, increase or decrease the free radical concentration) by changing the gas flow path in the process chamber, thus achieving the adjustment of etching effect on the wafer. For example, when more gas flows to some area on the wafer surface, the etching efficiency of such area will be improved. Therefore, the gas center ring can be set to change the gas flow path to eliminate the factors which result in uniform etching effect in different wafer areas and compensate other un-uniformity parameters (such as uneven wafer temperature distribution or uneven coupling energy distribution, etc.), to achieve more uniform etching effect in different wafer areas.\n",
      "However, the central opening diameter of gas center ring with the existing configuration is a fixed value. When the same process chamber (the hardware configuration of the equipment is fixed) is used to carry out different process treatment, the gas center ring with the fixed central opening diameter is unable to meet all process manufacturing requirements. Therefore, the process chamber must be opened to manually change the gas center ring with different opening diameters to adapt to different requirement, accompanied with complicated operations. In addition, once opened, the process chamber will expose to atmospheric environment, and the process chamber must be recovered to vacuum status or status before conducting the GCR replacement, which will prolong the duration of entire process procedure. Furthermore, it is difficult to confirm that whether the process conditions (pressure, temperature and coupling energy, etc.) in the process chamber are identical after each GCR replace step, which will have a significant influence on the efficiency and effects of process treatment.\n",
      "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "The objective of the present invention is to provide a device of changing gas flow pattern in the process chamber and a wafer processing method and apparatus. The gas center ring with adjustable gas flow diameter is constituted by different combinations in shape and/or height of fixed components and movable components, to meet different process manufacturing requirements, without opening the process chamber or manually changing other gas center rings under atmospheric environment. The gas center ring in the present invention can adjust the etching effect on the wafer by changing the gas flow pattern in the process chamber.\n",
      "In order to achieve above objective, the technical proposal of the present invention is to provide a device of changing the gas flow pattern in the process chamber; the gas introduced from the gas inlet to the process chamber will process the wafer in the process chamber, in which the gas inlet is located on the upper portion of the process chamber side wall; the top of the process chamber includes a lid, and a RF coil above the lid and connected to RF power supply.\n",

      "When the movable ring is in the second position, after the gas passes through the first opening on the fixed component, it flows in the space under the fixed component, above the wafer to make most gas flow to wafer central area.\n",
      "Preferably, the diameter of second opening on the movable ring is equal to or larger than the wafer diameter, so that the wafer is enclosed by the movable ring in the first position;\n",
      "The outer diameter of movable ring is equal to or slightly smaller than the first opening diameter of fixed component, so that the movable ring in the second position is enclosed by the first opening on fixed component.\n",

      "The gas center ring in the present invention also includes a movable component (FIG. 9) and the main body is a movable ring 20; plural adjusting rod 21 (for example 3 ones) is located under the movable ring 20, which is used to drive the movable ring 20 to raise or drop. There is a second opening 22 has the second diameter A2 in the center of movable ring 20, and the second diameter A2 in this embodiment is larger than the diameter of the wafer 50.\n",
      "As shown in FIG. 3, when the movable ring 20 drop to the first position, it will enclose the wafer 50. At this time, the movable ring 20 in the first position is located on the wafer supporting mechanism; the wafer supporting mechanism is generally an electrostatic chuck 41 (or called ESC) on a base 40 at the bottom of the process chamber 30, which will hold the wafer 50 during the process treatment.\n",
      "Thus, when the gas is introduced into the process chamber 30 through the gas inlet 60, it horizontally flows to the first opening 11 of the fixed component along the upper surface of fixed component 10 and then is delivered to the lower space of the chamber 30 via the first opening 11. That is to say, the introduced gas passes through the first opening 11 of the fixed component 10, and flows into the space under the fixed component 10, and above the wafer 50 and movable ring 20, thus more gas will flow to the wafer edge area, or even to the places away from the wafer 50.\n",
      "The outer diameter A4 of the moving ring 20 is designed adapt to the first diameter A1 (the diameter of the first opening 11 of fixed component 10). In this embodiment, the outer diameter A4 of the moving ring 20 is equal to or slightly smaller than the first diameter A1 of the first opening 11 of fixed component 10. As shown in FIG. 4, when the movable ring 20 raise to the second position, it can be filled into the first opening 11 of the fixed component 10. Therefore, the introduced gas horizontally flows to the second opening 22 of movable ring 20 along the upper surface of fixed component 10 and the movable ring 20, and flow downward to corresponding wafer 50 surface via the second opening 22; that is, after the introduced gas passes through the second opening 22 of movable ring 20, it flows into the space under the fixed component 10, movable ring 20 and above wafer 50, to make more gas flow toward the wafer central area.\n",
      "In another embodiment as shown in FIGS. 5, 6 and 8, in addition to the first opening 11′ in the center of fixed component 10′, there are several passages 81 (FIG. 8) penetrating the fixed component 10′. These passages 81 are distributed in the ring area surrounding the first opening 11′ on the fixed component 10′; three arc-shaped passages 81 as shown in the drawing have no restriction on the quantity, shape or layout of passages 81 on the fixed component 10′; the passages 81 could be in the form of groove and hole.\n",
      "In this embodiment, corresponding areas right under these passages 81 are beyond the wafer 50 boundary, corresponding to the position of the movable ring 20. As shown in FIG. 6, when the movable ring 20 ascends to the second position to completely cover these passages 81, the gas can only be delivered downwards through the first opening 11′ on fixed component 10′, and the gas flows in the interval gasps under the fixed component 10′, movable ring 20 and above the wafer 50, to make more gas flow to the wafer central area.\n",
      "As shown in FIG. 5, when the movable ring 20 descends to the first position, the gas could be delivered downwards simultaneously through the first opening 11′ on fixed component 10′ and passages 81, and the gas flows in the interval passages under the fixed component 10′, above the movable ring 20 and the wafer 50; even the first opening 11′ exists in the center of fixed component 10′, and further the first opening 11′ has a diameter A3 smaller than wafer 50 diameter, still more gas will flow to the wafer edge area or even the places away from the wafer 50.\n",
      "In above embodiments, taking FIG. 3 as an example, there is a first plate 71 on the fixed component 10 and 10′, and the first opening 11 and passages 81 set on the first plate 71; in addition, the fixed component 10 also has a second plate 71 which is connected to the side wall of process chamber 30; the second plate 72 is surrounded around the first plate 71; in this embodiment, the second plate 72 is higher than the first plate 71 in the vertical direction (the second plate may be lower than the first plate in other embodiments); the first plate 71 and the second plate 72 are connected by a side plate 73. The height relative to the wafer 50 surface of the first plate 71 on fixed component 10 and 10′ is considered as a control parameter to achieve gas flow pattern adjustment. The height relative to wafer 50 surface of the first plate 71 can be controlled by modifying the height difference between the first plate 71 and the second plate 72, for example, by modifying the height of side plate 73 (using the side plate 73 with different height or set the side plate 73 could be moved between upper and lower position), to meet the corresponding process recipe requirements.\n",
      "Another control parameter for gas flow pattern adjustment is the diameter size of the opening for gas passing through. According to the embodiments, the opening diameter is determined by the first opening diameter of fixed component (the first diameter A1 or the third diameter A3), the second opening 22 diameter of the movable ring 20 (the second diameter A2), the setting of passages 81 on fixed component 10′ and other comprehensive factors. For example, in the embodiments as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, by selecting different combinations of fixed component 10 and movable ring 20, the opening diameter of the gas center ring can be adjusted to the first diameter A1 of the first opening 11 on larger fixed component, or adjusted to the second diameter A2 of the second opening 22 of smaller movable ring 20. Another example can be found in embodiments as shown in FIGS. 5-8, by different combinations of fixed component 10′ and the movable ring 20, the opening diameter of the gas center ring can be adjusted to the diameter of passages 81 A1 on the outer fixed component 101′ (Plus the third diameter A3 of the first opening 11′ on the inner fixed component 102′), or adjusted to the third diameter A3 of the first opening 11′ of the smaller fixed component 10′. As shown in FIG. 8, the fixed component 10′ includes a outer fixed ring 101′ and an inner fixed ring 102′, which are connected through multiple interconnecting pieces; the opening diameter of outer fixed ring is A1 (A1 is larger than the diameter of the substrate), the opening diameter of inner fixed ring is A3 (A3 is smaller than the diameter of the substrate). The width of inner fixed ring can be designed very narrow, so that plural interconnecting pieces and inner fixed ring will not block the gas penetrate the larger opening of outer fixed ring and flow downwards when the movable ring is at lower position; when the movable ring moves upwards and block the passages 81 between outer and inner fixed rings, the gas channel with opening diameter A3 will be formed. Thus, the opening diameter of the gas center ring can be switched between two working modes: larger than the substrate diameter (A1) or smaller than the substrate diameter (A3), to enlarge the adjusting range of the gas center ring; meanwhile, it will not affect the maximum gas flow rate when the gas center ring is at the maximum opening A1. The horizontal width of inner fixed ring shall be smaller than 20% of the first opening diameter to ensure that it will not affect the gas flowing when the opening is maximized.\n",
      "The device of the present invention may have other different structures design, which can be mutually combined or combined with the above embodiments, to provide different controls on the gas flow pattern. For example, the fixed component 10″ can be a simple ring (FIG. 10), and the gas flow path diameter of gas center ring can be changed by adjusting the upper and lower position of adjustable ring 20.\n",
      "For example, the outer diameter of movable ring 20 can be larger than the diameter of first opening 11 on the fixed component 10, so the movable ring ascends to contact or near to lower surface of fixed component 10, that is, the movable ring 20 and the fixed component 10 are stacked, and these two have overlapping part (FIG. 10).\n",
      "Or, the outer diameter of movable ring 20 can be smaller than the diameter (A1 or A3) of first opening on fixed component, there is gap for gas passing between the raised movable ring 20 and the inner side of first opening. By adjustment, the gas can only flow through the first opening of fixed component or simultaneously flow through the gap and the second opening 22 of the movable ring 20 (FIG. 11).\n",
      "For example, the width of movable ring 20 is configurable, so that the ascending movable ring 20 could be designed to cover partial of the passages 81, while the gas can flow simultaneously through the passages 81 and the first opening 11′ of the fixed component 10′ (FIG. 12); however, the gas flow rate and other parameters can be adjusted to get a different gas distribution from the second embodiment (FIG. 5).\n",
      "For example, the movable ring is adjusted to stay at any position between the first position and the second position; different gas flow paths can be formed between the fixed component and movable ring, and between the movable ring and the wafer, to achieve additional control Knob on the gas flow pattern. When it is unnecessary to move the movable ring to the lowest position (the first position surrounding the wafer), the second diameter of the movable ring opening can be designed to be smaller than the wafer.\n",
      "For example, the adjusting rod can be set onto the lid of the chamber and has a lifting rod extend downward to connected onto upper surface of the movable ring, and the movable ring descends to the second position to match the first opening on fixed component, or the movable ring ascends to the lid of process chamber to be away from the fixed component. Or, the adjusting rod is horizontally configured to drive the movable ring to horizontally move between the position cover the opening of fixed component and the position away from the fixed component. Or, the movable ring includes multiple arc-shaped parts, which could moved together to form an entire movable ring match to the opening of fixed component, later the multiple parts could be separated and stored in different positions in the process chamber, etc.\n",
      "In conclusion, the present invention supply a gas center ring with a diameter configurable gas flow opening by configuring different combinations of fixed component and movable ring; the gas center ring with smaller opening diameter will guide more gas flow to wafer central area; while the gas center ring with larger opening diameter will guide more gas flow to wafer edge area or away from the wafer. The gas center ring with different diameters can be used to effectively change the gas flow path in the process chamber, to adjust the chemical reactant distribution in the process chamber, thus optimally adapting to the specific etching process and obtaining the best performance, such as the etching rate or critical dimension (CD) uniformity. Besides the etching tool, the device of the present invention can be applied to other wafer processing apparatus, by adjusting the gas flow pattern to form different wafer processing effects in said wafer processing apparatus. When the present invention adjusts the gas center ring diameter to adapt to different process recipe requirements, it could be automatically achieved in the process chamber under processing pressure, which could solve the problem encountered when the process chamber is manually opened to replace the gas center ring.\n",

      "DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS\n",
      "Various example embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals may refer to like elements throughout this application.\n",
      "FIG. 1 is a plan view illustrating a semiconductor device according to an example embodiment of the present inventive concept. FIGS. 2 to 5 are cross-sectional views taken along lines I-I′, II-II′, III-III′, and IV-IV′, respectively, of FIG. 1.\n",
      "Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a semiconductor device 100 includes fin structures, e.g., first and second fin structures, 110A and 1101B and a gate structure 130. The first and second fin structures 110A and 110B may extend in a first direction X and may be spaced apart from each other in a second direction Y. The first direction X may be perpendicular to the second direction Y. The gate structure 130 may extend in the second direction Y and may intersect the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B. The first and second fin structures 110A and 110B may protrude from a semiconductor substrate 101 in a direction perpendicular to an upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 101. Although two pair of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B are provided on the semiconductor substrate 101 as shown in FIGS. 1 to 5, but the present inventive concept is not limited thereto. For example, more than two pairs of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B may be provided on the semiconductor substrate 101. For example, a plurality of second fin structures may extend parallel to each other in the first direction X. Alternatively, one first fin structure 110A and/or one second fin structure 110B may be provided on the semiconductor substrate 101.\n",
      "Areas including the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B are defined as active regions, e.g., a first active region ACT1 and a second active region ACT2, respectively. An isolation region ISO may be disposed between and separating the first active region ACT1 and the second active region ACT2. For example, the semiconductor substrate 101 may include the first and second active regions ACT1 and ACT2 and the isolation region ISO. The isolation region ISO may include an insulating material. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the first active region ACT1 and the second active region ACT2 may include different types of impurities, and thus, may include different types of transistors. For example, the first active region ACT1 may include a p-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) transistor, and the second active region ACT2 may include an n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistor.\n",
      "In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, at least one of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B may include a first fin region F1 extending in the first direction X and a second fin region F2 extending in a different direction from the first direction X. As shown in FIG. 1, the first fin structure 110A in the first active region ACT1 may include the first fin region F1 and the second fin region F2.\n",
      "The second fin region F2 may be disposed between adjacent first fin regions F1 and may connect the first fin regions F1 positioned at different position levels in the second direction Y. The second fin region F2 may not extend in the first direction X and may extend in a direction inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to the first direction X. The first fin structure 110A including such first and second fin regions F1 and F2 may be formed by an extreme ultra-violate (EUV) lithography process.\n",
      "The semiconductor device 100 includes first contacts 150A and 150B and second contacts 160A and 160B. The first contacts 150A and 150B may respectively be connected to source/drain regions 120A and 120B as shown in FIG. 2. The first contacts 150A and 150B may refer to source/drain contacts. The second contacts 160A and 160B may be connected to a gate structure 130. The second contacts 160A and 160B may refer to gate contacts. As a size of the semiconductor device 100 is reduced and an integration thereof increases, a distance between the first contacts 150A and 150B and the second contacts 160A and 160B may decrease. Thus, a parasitic capacitance between the first contacts 150A and 150B and the second contacts 160A and 160B may increase and a short failure therebetween may be generated due to process failures.\n",
      "According to an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, since the second fin region F2 is formed in at least one of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B, the above problem may be solved. That is, as shown in FIG. 1, the first fin structure 110A includes the first fin region F1 and the second fin region F2, and the first fin structure 110A may have a shape with some portion bent in a predetermined direction. Accordingly, the first contact 150A connected to the source/drain region 120A on the second fin region F2 may be positioned at a position level in the second direction Y different from that of the first contact 150A connected to the source/drain region 120A on the first fin region F1. For example, two source/drain regions 120A may be disposed at opposite sides of the gate structure 130, in which the two source/drain regions 120A may be disposed at different position levels in the second direction Y. In addition, the first contact 150A connected to the source/drain region 120A on the second fin region F2 at one side of the gate structure 130 may be positioned at a level in the second direction Y the same as that of the first contact 150A connected to the source/drain region 120A on the second fin region F2 at the other side of the gate structure 130. Thus, the second contact 160A may be connected to the gate structure 130 and may be disposed between the second fin regions F2 in plan view.\n",
      "The bending shape of the first fin structure 110A may allow the first contact 150A to shift its position in the second direction Y and to move away from the second contact 160A. The first contact 150A on the second fin region F2 and the second contact 160A adjacent thereto may have a reduced facing area (or a reduced lateral overlapping area) therebetween. Accordingly, the short failure in which the first contact 150A is short-circuited with the second contact 160A may be prevented or reduced, and the parasitic capacitance between the first contact 150A and the second contact 160A may be minimized.\n",
      "The gate structure 130 is divided by a gate separation pattern CT. The gate separation pattern CT may be disposed on the isolation region ISO, and may extend into a lower insulating layer 103 surrounding the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B. The first active region ACT1 and the second active region ACT2 may be defined by an isolation layer 102 in the isolation region ISO. The lower insulating layer 103 may be disposed between the adjacent first fin structures 110A and between the adjacent second fin structures 110B.\n",
      "The source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be disposed at opposite sides of the gate structure 130, in which the source/drain regions 120A may be disposed on the first active region ACT1, and the source/drain regions 120B may be disposed on the second active region ACT2. The source/drain regions 120A and 120B may have a polygonal shape as shown in FIG. 2, but the present inventive concept is not limited thereto. For example, the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may have various shapes, e.g., a circular shape or a rectangular shape.\n",
      "The source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be disposed on the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B, respectively, and may have a merged structure or a coupled structure. One or both of the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be connected to the respective two first and second fin structures 110A and 110B as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, but the present inventive concept is not limited thereto. For example, the number of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B connected to respective ones of the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be variously changed. For example, the source/drain region 120A may be connected to more than two of a plurality of first fin structures 110A, and/or the source/drain region 120B may be connected to more than two of a plurality of second fin structures 110B. Alternatively, the source/drain region 120A may be connected to one first fin structure 110A, and/or the source/drain region 120B may be connected to one second fin structure 110B.\n",
      "A material forming the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be changed depending on the kind of the semiconductor device 100. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the PMOS transistor in the first active region ACT1 may include silicon-germanium (SiGe). The NMOS transistor in the second active region ACT2 may include silicon (Si).\n",
      "The source/drain regions 120A and 120B respectively includes first layers 121A and 121B and second layers 122A and 122B. The first layers 121A and 121B may be respectively grown from the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B. The second layers 122A and 122B may be respectively grown from the first layers 121A and 121B. The source/drain regions 120A and 120B may include n-type impurities or p-type impurities. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may include different impurity doping concentrations.\n",
      "The source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be respectively connected to the first contacts 150A and 150B. The gate structure 130 may be connected to the second contacts 160A and 160B. Referring to FIGS. 2 to 5, the first contacts 150A and 150B respectively includes first contact layers 151A and 151B and second contact layers 152A and 152B. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the first contact layers 151A and 151B may be barrier metal layers as diffusion barriers, and the second contact layers 152A and 152B may be fill metal layers having low electrical resistivity. The first contact layers 151A and 151B may include, e.g., titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN), and/or tungsten nitride (WN). The second contact layers 152A and 152B may include, e.g., tungsten (W), aluminum (Al), and/or molybdenum (Mo). The second contacts 160A and 160B may respectively have a structure similar to that of the first contacts 150A and 150B, and/or may respectively include a material similar to that of the first contacts 150A and 150B.\n",
      "In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, a metal silicide layer 145 may be disposed between each of the source/drain regions 120A and 120B and each of the first contacts 150A and 150B. The metal silicide layer 145 may be formed by reaction between silicon and one of, e.g., titanium (Ti), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), copper (Cu), tantalum (Ta), platinum (Pt), hafnium (Hf), molybdenum (Mo), radium (Ra), and an alloy thereof. The metal silicide layer 145 may be formed on a portion of an upper surface or an entire upper surface, of each of the source/drain regions 120A and 120B, and may be formed by depositing a metal on the source/drain regions 120A and 120B and annealing the metal.\n",
      "The first contacts 150A and 150B may respectively extend into the source/drain regions 120A and 120B. The source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be respectively formed by epitaxially growing using the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B as a seed. After forming a first interlayer insulating layer 171 on the source/drain regions 120A and 120B, the first interlayer insulating layer 171 may be etched and then the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may be recessed at a predetermined depth, such that a trench may be formed. The first contacts 150A and 150B may be formed by filling the trench with a conductive material. Accordingly, the first contacts 150A and 150B may respectively extend into the source/drain regions 120A and 120B at a predetermined depth.\n",
      "A second interlayer insulating layer 172 is disposed on the first interlayer insulating layer 171 to cover the first contacts 150A and 150B and the gate structure 130.

In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the second contacts 160A and 160B may penetrate the second interlayer insulating layer 172 to connect to the gate structure 130. For example, the second contacts 160A and 160B may be formed by etching the second interlayer insulating layer 172 to form a trench exposing the gate structure 130 and filling the trench with a conductive material. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the second contacts 160A and 160B may be positioned at a higher level than the first contacts 150A and 150B with respect to the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 101 (see, e.g., the second contact 260A and the first contact 250A of FIG. 8).\n",

Since the first contact 150A may be connected to the source/drain region 120A as shown in FIG. 2, the source/drain region 120A may be connected to the power line PL. The lower and upper vias V0 and V1 and the circuit pattern P0 may be covered by the second interlayer insulating layer 172 and an inter-metal insulating layer IML. For example, the lower via V0 may be disposed in the second interlayer insulating layer 172 and may be positioned at a level the same as that of the second contacts 160A and 160B. The upper via V1 may be disposed in the inter-metal insulating layer IML. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the first fin structure 110A including the first and second fin regions F1 and F2 may be bent toward the power line PL in plan view. The first contact 150A on the second fin region F2 may be closer than the first contact 150A on the first fin region F1 to the power line PL in plan view. Thus, the first contact 150A on the second fin region F2 may be easily connected to the power line PL.\n",

The gate insulating layer 131 may be disposed between the first gate metal layer 132 and each of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B. The capping layer 134 may be disposed on the gate insulating layer 131, the first gate metal layer 132, and the second gate metal layer 133, and may include an insulating material, e.g., silicon nitride (Si3N4). A gate spacer 140 is disposed on a sidewall of the gate structure 130, and may also include an insulating material, e.g., silicon oxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (Si3N4), and/or silicon oxynitride (SiON).

      "The first fin structure 110A may include a lower fin region 111A and an upper fin region 112A. The gate structure 130 may cover the upper fin region 112A and may extend in the second direction Y. The upper fin region 112A may be connected to the semiconductor substrate 101 through the lower fin region 11 IA and may serve as a channel region of a transistor included in the semiconductor device.\n",
      "As described above, the first fin structure 110A may include the first fin region F1 and the second fin region F2. Unlike the first fin region F1 which extends in the first direction X, the second fin region F2 may not extend in the first direction X. Thus, as shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4, position levels of the first fin structure 110A in the second direction Y, which is covered by the adjacent gate structures 130 with the second fin region F2 therebetween, may be different from each other. For example, the adjacent two gate structures 130 may overlap the first fin structure 110A at two adjacent first fin regions F1. Thus, the second fin region F2 may be disposed between these two adjacent first fin regions F1 and may connect these two first fin regions F1 which are positioned at different position levels. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 5, in the case of the second fin structure 110B without the second fin region F2, position levels of the second fin structure 110B in the second direction Y, which is covered by the adjacent gate structures 130, may be the same.\n",

The second contacts 160A′ and 160B′ may be connected to the gate structure 130.\n",
      "To reduce or prevent a parasitic capacitance or a short failure between the first contacts 150A′ and 150B′ and the second contacts 160A′ and 160B′, the first fin structure 110A′ may include a slope portion. For example, the slope portion of the first fin structure 110A′ may extend in a direction which is different from the first and second directions X and Y and is parallel to the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate (see, e.g., 101 of FIG. 2). That is, the first fin structure 110A′ may include the slope portion nonparallel to the first direction X unlike the second fin structure 110B′ extending parallel to the first direction X. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the slope portion of the first fin structure 110A′ may be disposed in a second region A2 of the semiconductor substrate (see, e.g., 101 of FIG. 2) including a first region A1 and the second region A2.

The distance D2 may have different values depending on the location. The distance D2 may have a value greater than that of the distance D1, as shown in FIG. 6.\n",
      "The isolation region ISO may be disposed between the first fin structure 110A′ and the second fin structure 110B′. The isolation region ISO may be formed by etching a portion of the semiconductor substrate (see, e.g., 101 of FIG. 2) to form a trench and filling the trench with an insulating material. The isolation region ISO may have a shape corresponding to the first fin structure 110A′ and the second fin structure 110B′. The isolation region ISO may include a first isolation region ISO1 and a second isolation region ISO2 that are connected to each other in the first direction X, and the first isolation region ISO1 and the second isolation region ISO2 may have different widths in the second direction Y. The first isolation region ISO1 and the second isolation region ISO2 may correspond to the first region A1 and the second region A2, respectively. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, a width of the second isolation region ISO2 in the second direction Y may be greater than a width of the first isolation region ISO1 in the second direction Y. This is because the second isolation region ISO2 is formed adjacent to the second fin region F2 of the first fin structure 110A′. Similar to the distance D2, the width of the second isolation region ISO2 in the second direction Y may have different values depending on the location.\n",

      "The distance between the first fin structure 210A and the second fin structure 210B may be varied from D1 to D2. The reason is that the first fin structure 210A and the second fin structure 210B are not parallel to each other in the second fin region F2. In a region in which the distance between the first fin structure 210A and the second fin structure 210B is D2, the first contact 250A and the second contact 260A may not face each other or may have a reduced facing area (or a reduced lateral overlapping area) therebetween. Thus, a short failure between the first contact 250A and the second contact 260A may be reduced or prevented, and a parasitic capacitance therebetween may also be minimized.\n",

      "Referring to FIGS. 23 to 25, the dummy gate structure 180 is replaced with the gate structure 130. The gate separation pattern CT is formed to divide the gate structure 130 into sections. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the gate separation pattern CT may be formed prior to the formation of the gate structure 130.\n",
      "Before replacing the dummy gate structure 180 with the gate structure 130, a first interlayer insulating layer 171 may be formed to cover the dummy gate structure 180 and the source/drain regions 120A and 120B. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, an upper surface of the first interlayer insulating layer 171 may be coplanar with an upper surface of the dummy gate structure 180. After forming the first interlayer insulating layer 171, a portion of the dummy gate structure 180 corresponding to the gate separation pattern CT may be removed by an etching process, and an insulating material may fill a region where the portion of dummy gate structure 180 is removed, thus forming the gate separation pattern CT.\n",
      "When forming the gate separation pattern CT, the dummy gate structure 180 between the adjacent gate spacers 140 may be removed. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, after forming the first interlayer insulating layer 171, the mask pattern layer 183 of the dummy gate structure 180 may be removed by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. The gate structure 130 may be formed in a space between the adjacent gate spacers 140, where the dummy gate structure 180 is removed.\n",
      "Referring to FIGS. 24 and 25, the gate structure 130 includes the gate insulating layer 131, the first gate metal layer 132, the second gate metal layer 133, and the capping layer 134 sequentially stacked on the semiconductor substrate 101. The gate insulating layer 131 may be conformally formed along an inner surface of the space between the adjacent gate spacers 140 and may include, e.g., oxide, nitride, and/or a high-k dielectric material with a dielectric constant higher than that of silicon oxide (SiO2). The gate insulating layer 131 may cover the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B exposed between the adjacent gate spacers 140.\n",
      "The first and second gate metal layers 132 and 133 may include, e.g., metal and/or polysilicon. In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the first and second gate metal layers 132 and 133 may include different materials. The first gate metal layer 132 may serve as a barrier metal layer to prevent metal diffusion and may include, e.g., titanium nitride (TiN). The second gate metal layer 133 may include metal, e.g., tungsten (W), copper (Cu), and/or molybdenum (Mo), or polysilicon (Si). In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, an additional metal layer may further be formed between the first gate metal layer 132 and the second gate metal layer 133.\n",
      "The capping layer 134 may cover the gate insulating layer 131 and the first and second gate metal layers 132 and 133 and may include an insulating material, e.g., silicon nitride (Si3N4). Referring to FIG. 24, the capping layer 134 may not be formed in a predetermined region in the second direction Y. For example, the capping layer 134 may be divided into a plurality of sections. In the region where the capping layer 134 is not formed, upper surfaces of the first and second gate metal layers 132 and 133 may be exposed.\n",
      "Referring to FIGS. 26 to 28, the first contacts 150A and 150B and the second contacts 160A and 160B are formed. The first contacts 150A and 150B may be respectively connected to the source/drain regions 120A and 120B. The second contacts 160A and 160B may be connected to the gate structure 130.\n",
      "The first contacts 150A and 150B may be formed by removing a portion of the first interlayer insulating layer 171 by an etching process and filling the removed region with a conductive material. When performing the etching process on the first interlayer insulating layer 171, portions of the source/drain regions 120A and 120B may also be removed. After forming the first contacts 150A and 150B, a second interlayer insulating layer 172 may be formed on the first interlayer insulating layer 171. The first and second interlayer insulating layers 171 and 172 may include, e.g., silicon oxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (Si3N4), and/or silicon oxynitride (SiON). The first and second interlayer insulating layers 171 and 172 may form the interlayer insulating layer 170. The second contacts 160A and 160B may be formed in a region where a portion of the second interlayer insulating layer 172 is removed and may be connected to the gate structure 130. The second contacts 160A and 160B may be formed by removing a portion of the first interlayer insulating layer 171, in the region of the gate structure 130 where the capping layer 134 is not formed, by an etching process and filling the removed region with a conductive material.\n",
      "When the process of forming the first contacts 150A and 150B and the second contacts 160A and 160B are not controlled, a short failure in which a respective one of the first contacts 150A and 150B and a respective one of the second contacts 160A and 160B are connected (or short-circuited) may be generated. In addition, as the respective one of the first contacts 150A and 150B and the respective one of the second contacts 160A and 160B are closer to each other, a parasitic capacitance therebetween may increase.\n",
      "According to an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, the above described problem may be solved by adjustment of a shape of at least one of the first and second fin structures 110A and 110B. As described above with reference to FIGS. 1 and 12, the first fin structure 110A may include the first fin region F1 and the second fin region F2, and the second fin region F2 may extend in a direction different from the first direction X. Thus, the first fin structure 110A may have a bending shape in at least a predetermined section. The bending shape of the first fin structure 110A may allow the first contact 150A to shift its position in the second direction Y and to move away from the second contact 160A. The first contact 150A on the second fin region F2 and the second contact 160A adjacent thereto may have a reduced facing area (or a reduced lateral overlapping area) therebetween. Accordingly, the short failure in which the first contact 150A is short-circuited with the second contact 160A may be prevented or reduced, and the parasitic capacitance between the first contact 150A and the second contact 160A may be minimized.\n",
      "As shown in FIG. 26, the source/drain region 120A on the second fin region F2 may be disposed at a position level different from that of another source/drain region 120A on the first fin region F1, in the second direction Y. Thus, the first contact 150A may be formed remote from the second contact 160A and a facing area between the first contact 150A and the second contact 160A may be reduced. Accordingly, the parasitic capacitance between the first contact 150A and the second contact 160A may be reduced and the short failure may be reduced or prevented from occurring during the formation of the first contact 150A and the second contact 160A. The second contact 160A may be connected to the upper surface of the gate structure 130, exposed in a region where the capping layer 134 is not formed.\n",
      "While the present inventive concept has been shown and described with reference to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present inventive concept as set forth by the following claims.\n",
